📉 Goride – Trip Cancellation & Operations Analysis
📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes trip cancellations at Goride to understand why trips are being canceled, who is responsible, and how cancellations impact revenue and customer retention.

The goal is to move beyond reporting metrics and provide actionable operational insights.

❓ Business Problem

Goride faces a 25% trip cancellation rate

High customer churn after cancellations

Lack of clarity on:

Top cancellation reasons

Operational factors (waiting times, vehicle type, region)

🛠 Tools & Technologies

Excel (Data cleaning & Pivot Analysis)

Power BI (KPIs, Visuals, Dashboarding)

Analytical Techniques

Root Cause Analysis

KPI Design

Operational Performance Analysis

📊 Key Metrics

Total Trips: 150K

Total Canceled Trips: 37.5K

Cancellation Rate: 25%

Driver-side Cancellations: 27K

Customer-side Cancellations: 10.5K

Revenue from Completed Trips: 47.3M

🔍 Key Insights

72% of cancellations are driver-related

Long VTAT & CTAT significantly increase cancellation likelihood

Certain vehicle types (GO XL, Premier Sedan) show higher waiting times

Customer churn is severe:

💡 Conclusion

Trip cancellations at Goride are primarily driven by operational inefficiencies, not customer behavior.
Reducing waiting times and addressing driver-side issues would have the highest impact on revenue and customer retention.
