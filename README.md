## 📌 Project Overview
**Goride**, a ride-booking platform, faced a critical operational challenge in 2024 with a high rate of unfulfilled trips. This project analyzes the root causes of trip cancellations, quantifies the **revenue leakage**, and assesses the impact on customer retention.

The goal was to transform raw data into actionable insights to help the Operations and Finance teams reduce the **25% cancellation rate** and recover **~$17.3M in potential revenue**.

## 💼 The Business Problem
Management reported an increase in customer complaints and revenue loss but lacked visibility into the "Why".
**Key Business Questions:**
* Who is responsible for cancellations (Driver vs. Customer)?
* What is the financial impact of unfulfilled demand?
* How do waiting times (VTAT/CTAT) correlate with cancellations?
* Does cancellation drive customer churn?

## 🔍 Key Insights & Findings

### 1. The "Driver" Bottleneck
* [cite_start]**72%** of all cancellations are initiated by **Drivers**[cite: 150].
* [cite_start]The top reason cited is *"Customer related issue/sick"*[cite: 141], suggesting a potential loophole in the cancellation policy being abused to avoid penalties.

### 2. Financial Impact (Revenue Leakage)
* [cite_start]**Realized Revenue:** $47.3M from completed trips[cite: 220].
* [cite_start]**Lost Revenue (Estimated):** ~$17.3M[cite: 222].
* [cite_start]**Insight:** Fixing the cancellation issue presents a **36% revenue growth opportunity**[cite: 280].

### 3. Customer Retention Crisis
* The cancellation experience is fatal to loyalty.
* [cite_start]**37,000 customers** stopped booking immediately after a cancellation event[cite: 269].
* [cite_start]**Return Rate:** Negligible (<1.5% returned to book again)[cite: 270, 271].

### 4. Operational Gaps
* [cite_start]**Go XL** vehicle type suffers from the highest **Vehicle Time to Arrival (VTAT)** [cite: 174][cite_start], leading to higher cancellation rates in specific regions like *Pulbangash* and *Laxmi Nagar*[cite: 178, 179].
